# Agentic AI 



The difference between **LLMs (Large Language Models)** and **Agentic AI** lies in **capability, behavior, and autonomy**. Here's a concise comparison:

---

### üîπ 1. **Definition**

**LLM (Large Language Model)**:
A foundational AI model trained on vast amounts of text to predict and generate human-like language. It responds to prompts but **does not have goals or plans** on its own.
**Example**: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA.

**Agentic AI**:
An AI system that **exhibits agent-like behavior**, including the ability to plan, make decisions, take actions, and use tools to accomplish goals **autonomously or semi-autonomously**.
**Example**: Auto-GPT, OpenAI's GPTs with tool use and memory, or LangChain-based agents.

---

### üîπ 2. **Autonomy and Goal Orientation**

| Aspect       | LLM                                            | Agentic AI                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autonomy** | Stateless, reactive                            | Goal-driven, can act autonomously                                |
| **Memory**   | No persistent memory (unless added externally) | Maintains memory and state across tasks                          |
| **Planning** | No inherent planning                           | Uses planning and decision-making loops                          |
| **Tool Use** | Only if explicitly integrated                  | Can autonomously select and use tools (e.g., search, code, APIs) |

---

### üîπ 3. **Architecture**

* **LLM**: A passive component ‚Äî receives input and returns output.
* **Agentic AI**: Combines an LLM with other components like:

  * A **planner** (to break down goals into tasks)
  * A **memory module**
  * **Tool interfaces**
  * **Feedback loops**

---

### üîπ 4. **Examples**

* **LLM**: You ask, ‚ÄúTranslate this text,‚Äù and it gives a translation.
* **Agentic AI**: You ask, ‚ÄúResearch this topic and summarize five recent papers,‚Äù and it:

  1. Plans a search strategy
  2. Uses tools to search the web or databases
  3. Reads and summarizes papers
  4. Returns a consolidated report

---

### üîπ 5. **Analogy**

* **LLM** = Brain without a body or goals.
* **Agentic AI** = An AI assistant with a brain (LLM), memory, tools (hands), and goals ‚Äî capable of independent action.
