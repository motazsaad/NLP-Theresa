# RAG tools 

There are open-source RAG tools that you can use without heavy coding, or even no coding at all!. Here are the best options you can start with:

## LlamaIndex / LlamaParse
LlamaIndex provides a no-code interface (with LlamaParse) to upload documents and query them using LLMs with RAG.

Good for: Uploading PDFs or Word files, automatically parsing them, building a RAG app easily.

### How:

1. Go to LlamaParse
2. Upload your documents.
3. Ask questions like: "Extract all .........", and get answers.

Note: LlamaParse is free up to a certain limit. You can integrate it later with your own LLM if you want full control.

## Flowise AI
Flowise is a visual builder for LLM apps, including RAG. Itâ€™s drag-and-drop, no real coding needed.

Good for: Build customized RAG workflows visually (like building a flowchart).

### How:
1. Install Flowise locally or use a hosted version.
2. Connect document loaders, embeddings, LLMs, all visually.
