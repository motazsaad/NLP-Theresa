### Using Generative AI to Evaluate RAG Systems for ESG KPI Extraction

Generative AI can assist in evaluating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for ESG KPI extraction by automating and improving the evaluation process. Below is a structured framework for leveraging generative AI in this context:

---

### 1. **Automatic Ground Truth Comparison**
Generative AI can compare RAG-generated outputs with the ground truth dataset (e.g., manually extracted KPIs) and assess:

- **Correctness**: Whether the extracted KPIs match the ground truth.
- **Relevance**: Whether the extracted KPIs are contextually relevant.
- **Completeness**: Whether all expected KPIs are extracted.

**Example Prompt**:  
> Compare the RAG-generated carbon emissions values with the ground truth. Highlight differences and classify the output as "correct," "partially correct," or "incorrect."

#### Benefits:
- Handles fuzzy matching for textual KPIs (e.g., "CO2 emissions" vs. "carbon dioxide emissions").
- Assesses partial correctness for numerical or complex values.

---

### 2. **Relevance of Retrieved Documents**
Generative AI can evaluate whether the retrieved documents provide sufficient and relevant information for KPI extraction.

**Example Prompt**:  
> Given the query "What are the total carbon emissions?" and the retrieved document snippet, assess whether the document contains sufficient information for extracting this KPI. Rate relevance on a scale of 1-5.

#### Use Case:
- Diagnoses issues in the **retrieval module** (e.g., irrelevant or incomplete document retrieval).

---

### 3. **Faithfulness and Consistency**
Generative AI can verify the faithfulness of the generated outputs by checking alignment with the retrieved documents.

**Example Prompt**:  
> Review the retrieved document and the RAG output for extracting ESG KPIs. Determine whether the output is factually accurate and consistent with the retrieved text. Provide a faithfulness score (1-5) and highlight discrepancies.

#### Key Insights:
- Detects hallucinations or inconsistencies in the generated KPIs.
- Ensures numerical values and categorical mentions align with source data.

---

### 4. **Holistic Evaluation with Custom Metrics**
Generative AI can assess multiple quality dimensions simultaneously, including:

- **Correctness**: Accuracy of extracted KPIs.
- **Completeness**: Whether all relevant KPIs are extracted.
- **Relevance**: Whether the output aligns with the query and ground truth.
- **Clarity**: Whether the output is well-structured and coherent.

**Example Prompt**:  
> Evaluate the RAG output for ESG KPI extraction against the ground truth. Provide scores for:  
> - Correctness (1-5).  
> - Completeness (1-5).  
> - Relevance (1-5).  
> Summarize the overall quality and suggest improvements.

---

### 5. **Error Categorization and Analysis**
Generative AI can identify and categorize errors in RAG outputs, helping diagnose issues in retrieval and generation.

**Example Prompt**:  
> Compare the RAG output to the ground truth. Identify errors as:  
> - Missing KPIs.  
> - Incorrect numerical values.  
> - Irrelevant information.  
> Provide recommendations to reduce such errors.

#### Outcome:
- A detailed error report to guide system improvement.

---

### 6. **Usability and Coherence**
Generative AI can assess the readability and usability of the RAG-generated outputs, ensuring they meet user expectations.

**Example Prompt**:  
> Review the extracted ESG KPIs for clarity and usability. Rate the output on:  
> - Readability (1-5).  
> - Logical structure (1-5).  
> - Relevance to the userâ€™s query.  
> Suggest ways to improve formatting and presentation.

---

### 7. **Fine-Tuning Generative AI as an Evaluator**
Generative AI can be fine-tuned on annotated evaluation data for recurring tasks, such as:

- Comparing RAG outputs to ground truth.
- Scoring outputs for correctness, relevance, and faithfulness.
- Generating evaluation summaries automatically.

#### Benefits:
- Reduces human intervention for routine assessments.
- Ensures consistency in evaluation results.

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Prepare Input Data**: Ensure both ground truth and RAG outputs are structured in comparable formats.
2. **Use Generative AI**: Prompt the model to evaluate outputs based on the required metrics.
3. **Automate the Process**: Integrate evaluation into the pipeline using tools like programmatic APIs or automation frameworks.
4. **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously refine the evaluation process as the RAG system evolves.

### Example Metrics to Evaluate

| Metric              | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Precision**       | Proportion of correctly extracted KPIs out of all extracted KPIs. |
| **Recall**          | Proportion of correctly extracted KPIs out of all expected KPIs.  |
| **F1-Score**        | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.                            |
| **Faithfulness**    | Alignment of generated output with retrieved documents.           |
| **Completeness**    | Percentage of expected KPIs extracted correctly.                  |
| **Relevance**       | Quality of alignment between the query and the output.            |

### Automation Tools
- **Programming Frameworks**: Use Python for handling ground truth comparisons, metrics computation, and automation.
- **AI Integration**: Use tools like LangChain or similar frameworks to chain prompts and automate the evaluation pipeline.

By leveraging generative AI, you can streamline and enhance the evaluation of your RAG system for ESG KPI extraction, ensuring accurate, relevant, and complete outputs.
